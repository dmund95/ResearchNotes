**Happy researching!** üìñ‚ú® 

## üèÜ **Recommended: Use a Ruby Version Manager**

The best practice is to use **rbenv** (or **rvm**) to manage Ruby versions:

### Install rbenv (macOS):
```bash
# Install rbenv via Homebrew
brew install rbenv ruby-build

# Add to your shell profile (~/.zshrc)
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Install a Ruby version (Jekyll works well with 3.1.x)
rbenv install 3.1.4
rbenv local 3.1.4  # Set for this project only
```

Then run:
```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## üê≥ **Alternative: Docker (Complete Isolation)**

If you want complete isolation, use Docker:

```bash
# Run Jekyll in a container
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$PWD":/srv/jekyll \
  -p 4000:4000 \
  jekyll/jekyll:4 \
  bash -c "bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **System Ruby + Bundler (Minimal Protection)**

If you just use system Ruby with Bundler:
- Bundler will install gems in your user directory (not system-wide)
- Some isolation, but less clean than rbenv
- Generally safe but not as organized

## **What I'd Recommend:**

1. **Use rbenv** - It's the Ruby community standard and gives you clean version isolation
2. Your `Gemfile` uses GitHub Pages gems, which are well-maintained and safe
3. Bundler already provides gem-level isolation even without rbenv

Would you like me to help you set up rbenv, or would you prefer to try one of the other approaches?
